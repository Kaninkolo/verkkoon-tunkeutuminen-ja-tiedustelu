I personally use contactless payment with my credit/debit card, as well as have used RFID cards at all of the workplaces I've worked at. I personally haven't protected myself from RFID skimming at all, but also there is an added security because typically at workplace they have required a PIN and the card to access areas, and with contactless payment it asks the PIN code as well after using it a couple of times and I believe the protection measures in credit cards will protect me unless a thief has stolen POS terminal.

## Explore APDU command structure

I looked at the [Rust documentation](https://docs.rs/apdu/latest/apdu/) regarding the APDU command structure, it consists of Header: CLA INS P1 P2 and the body which may have LC then the payload and LE. Header is always required where as the body is variable. From my understanding LC calculates it's value from the payload that is sent and LE is whether a response is expected from the device and what length is expected, so the LC is always sent when you are sending data and LE is sent when you are expecting to receive data or a combination of both if you are sending data and expecting a response.

## Find and research an article regarding RFID hacking

I found an interesting article regarding hacking cars, I believe it was also mentioned during class, but the thiefs are able to point a signal capture device at the car keys which are typically inside of the house and relay the signal to the car which automatically unlocks the car.
